## 🔥 Features
- Variety of Monty opcodes supported: `push`, `pop`, `swap`, `add` and much more!
- Robust error handling for those unexpected moments.
- Dual-mode support: Stack (LIFO) & Queue (FIFO).

## 🛠 Installation and Usage

git clone [[repository_link](https://github.com/Capnot34/monty.git)]

1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd path_to_directory

1. Compile the source files:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty

1. Run the interpreter:
./monty your_file.m

## 📋 Task Descriptions
- **push, pall:** Lays the foundation with the basic opcodes, `push` and `pall`.
- **pint:** Displays the value at the top of the stack.
- **pop:** Removes the top element of the stack.
